# CATIA-R2018x-VBScripts
I have added some of my VBScript macros from 3DExperience CATIA here.

1. Update Drawing macro
  This macro handles updating of all the views in the drawing from all sheets, update drawing heading fields from related part metadata and adding made, checked and approved by user input.
  
  
2. Rename Drawing macro
  This macro was made to enable user to add multiple drawings under same part or assembly. It allows to add a suffix for the drawing name(number).
